## Other Enhancements 

- Added `fishing.html` as one of my hobby, I think I including more personal interests provides a more well-rounded view of who I am beyond coding and helps create a sense of connection for anyone visiting. 

- Added **Konami Code** Easter egg. When the user enters the sequence of specific arrow keys and letters, an alert pops up to confirm successful entry. I chose to implement this feature to give the site a fun hidden interaction, encouraging users to explore and discover playful surprises.
